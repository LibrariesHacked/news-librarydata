It’s about the city we want to live in. And the idea of a city that we maybe had a decade ago is not going to exist soon. The problem is, with these piecemeal proposed changes, we might not notice until it’s too late, if it’s not too late already. I understand the desire to reduce a service rather than close it completely, but this does more harm than good. The reduced service becomes normalised and then it can be reduced again, until there’s nothing left. And a reduced service by definition is used less, because it’s available less, so its relevance to the community goes down and cutting it further doesn’t feel so bad.&#34;","2017/01/honours-and-the-year-in-review.html"],["Devon","Mon, 02 Jan 2017 13:06:06 +0000","Devon – Exeter library boss among those from Devon to receive New Year Honour – Exeter Express and Echo.","2017/01/honours-and-the-year-in-review.html"],["Durham","Mon, 02 Jan 2017 13:06:06 +0000","Durham – Newton Aycliffe Library Reopens in Leisure Centre – Newton News. &#34;Newton Aycliffe Library has reopened to the public with a new look in a new location.The library’s bright and modern new base, within the town’s leisure centre on Beveridge Way, includes sections for teenagers and children, a study area and updated computer facilities.It also offers a wide selection of current and classic titles as well as e-books and e-mags.
